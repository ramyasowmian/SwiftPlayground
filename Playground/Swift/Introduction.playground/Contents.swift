Introduction

Technical round
  I’m Ramya, and I have 8.5 years of experience in iOS application development. I’m currently working at Tech Mahindra on the Bell Canada project, which is part of the telecommunications sector.

The project is architected using both MVP-R and MVVM-R patterns, implemented in a modular structure to promote scalability and maintainability. Each feature is developed using appropriate design patterns. We use Swift and SwiftUI, along with Combine for reactive programming and data binding.

We follow best practices like unit testing, and the entire development process is integrated into a CI/CD pipeline to support automated testing and continuous delivery.



Managerial round

 I’m Ramya, and I have 8.5 years of experience in iOS application development. I’m currently with Tech Mahindra, working on a large-scale telecommunications project for Bell Canada.

In this role, I’ve been actively involved in designing and developing features using MVVM-R and MVP-R architectures within a modular framework. I work with Swift, SwiftUI, and Combine, and we follow best practices like unit testing and integration with a full CI/CD pipeline.

Beyond coding, I’ve collaborated closely with cross-functional teams — including QA, DevOps, product owners, and business analysts — to ensure timely and quality delivery. I’ve also contributed to architectural discussions, code reviews, and have taken ownership of several key modules from design to release.
